## API

This is a basic API designed with RESTFul principles and best practices in mind.

The different available endpoints are documented [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/2111440/RWTmuyJV) and all private endpoints must have an authorization header with a Bearer token.

The token is issued when an user is registered and when an existing user logs in. The API accepts and always responds with a json body.

## TODO
* Add missing authentication features (activate users, reset password)
* Add logger to use instead of `console.log`
* Add internationalization
* Add automated tests
